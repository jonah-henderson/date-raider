# Date Raider

Date Raider rewritten from the ground up in Vue 3. Start with $5,000 and try to make a fortune in simulated trading of real stocks.

## Known issues

- Accessibility needs to be improved
- The app is mostly responsive, but there's still room for improvement on extremely small screens
- UI/UX polish (less aggressive 'invalid API key warning', ability to reset the app, smoother loading experience, candle graphs)
